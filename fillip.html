				    	<p><strong>ANTICIPATORY DESIGN. </strong>The group began by identifying a sector with an opportunity for design intervention. We were inspired by the concept of anticipatory design, and removing unnecessary choices to someone’s day and preventing the well-documented phenomenon of decision fatigue: meaning the more things we decide on over the course of a day, the less ability we have to make effective decisions. We saw potential to apply the concept of anticipatory design to fulfill a missing need of individuals living in urban areas. We found that across cities, people were experiencing friction when trying to come up with ideas for fun and interesting things to do.</P>

				    	<p><strong>INSPIRATION AND PRECEDENTS. </strong>Websites like VancityBuzz and city government websites collect lists of events and activities in the city, but they are presented to individuals as merely a list format, with no ability to filter or create personalized suggestions. It becomes very difficult to sort through these large lists and find interesting things to do, and individuals may end up giving up and feeling bored once again.</P>

		    			<div class="hidden-h2"><h2>Research Analysis.</h2></div>

			    		<p><strong>PERSONAS. </strong>The team began the process by creating personas to help identify the goals, needs, and concerns of potential application users. This consisted of conducting interviews with a variety of individuals we believed may be interested in this style of mobile application. Information gathered from these interviews were then analysed and translated into different personas. Two examples are below.</p>

                        <div class="padding">
                            <div class="col-1of2"><img src="img/persona1.png" alt="a persona of a student named Harry"></div>
                            <div class="col-1of2"><img src="img/persona2.png" alt="a persona of a father named Nicholas"></div>
                        </div>


		    			
			    		<p><strong>PRINCIPLES. </strong>The team then ideated a set of principles based on the goals and needs of our personas that would inform any interface and design decisions. By staying within the constraints of these principles, we could ensure that the application was always being designed with our user’s goals and needs in mind.</p>

			    		<div class="grid padding">
			    			<div class="col-1of3"><p><strong>ANTICIPATORY. </strong>As our users want a personalized experience, Fillip should anticipate relevant activities based on user’s history.</p>
			    			</div>
			    			<div class="col-1of3"><p><strong>AUTONOMOUS. </strong>As our users aspire to make their own decisions, Fillip should give them resources, and act as a catalyst to find activities.</p>
			    			</div>
			    			<div class="col-1of3"><p><strong>DELIGHTFUL AND PLAYFUL. </strong>As our users are lighthearted and spontaneous, Fillip should have a personality to match this, using a voice and tone guide.</p>
			    			</div>
			    		</div>
			    		<div class="grid padding">			    		
			    			<div class="col-1of3"><p><strong>EFFICIENT. </strong>Our users are busy individuals who want to be spontaneous with any free time they have, so Fillip should maximise their productivity when finding activities.</p>
			    			</div>
			    			<div class="col-1of3"><p><strong>SOCIAL. </strong>Our users seek to spend quality time with their friends and family, so Fillip should help promote this while not getting in the way during the activities themselves.</p>
			    			</div>
			    			<div class="col-1of3"><p><strong>LOW RESISTANCE. </strong>As our users want to make quick decisions, Fillip should provide them with just enough information without an abundance of content.</p>
			    			</div>			    						    						  		
						</div>

			    		<p><strong>JOURNEY FRAMEWORK. </strong>A journey framework was then created with these principles in mind.</p>

						<p><strong>INITIAL WIREFRAMES. </strong>These gray box wireframes allowed the team to conduct initial evaluations of the interface design. For example, each member of the team conducted a heuristic evaluation, which illuminated problems with an excess of information and a lack of minimalist design.</p>

                        <p><strong>USER TESTING. </strong> The interface was then fully prototyped and several rounds of usability testing were conducted to allow for refinement and to solve any usability problems. We had participants walk through several tasks using the prototyped application and employed the think-aloud protocol. This, combined with a pre- and post-test questionnaire helped to establish problem areas. We found that our color usage was repetitive, our button hierarchy needed to be improved, the decision-making needed to be simplified, and the implementation of providing users achievements was unnecessary and confusing (and was therefore removed). See mockups tested below:</p>

                        <p><strong>Style Guide. </strong>After the completion of user testing, the final prototype of the application was completed. For every step of the application, we wanted it to be as simple and straightforward as possible for users to move through the system but still allow for customization. Below is the style guide that informed the final interface design decisions:.</p>

                        <p><strong>MY ROLES. </strong>Throughout the course of this process, I acted as project manager of the team. Not only did I participate in the creation and ideation of personas, principles,   wireframes, prototypes, and testing, I was also in charge of delegating roles for groupmates and ensuring that any design elements remained consistent across screens being designed. Furthermore, I was in charge of all content and copy creation, and designed the Activity Decision screens. I also created all motion graphics for the final video proposal.</p>
