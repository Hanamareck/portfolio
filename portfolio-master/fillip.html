				    	<p><strong>ANTICIPATORY DESIGN. </strong>The group began by identifying a sector with an opportunity for design intervention. We were inspired by the concept of anticipatory design, and removing unnecessary choices to someone’s day and preventing the well-documented phenomenon of decision fatigue: meaning the more things we decide on over the course of a day, the less ability we have to make effective decisions. We saw potential to apply the concept of anticipatory design to fulfill a missing need of individuals living in urban areas. We found that across cities, people were experiencing friction when trying to come up with ideas for fun and interesting things to do.</P>

				    	<p><strong>INSPIRATION AND PRECEDENTS. </strong>Websites like VancityBuzz and city government websites collect lists of events and activities in the city, but they are presented to individuals as merely a list format, with no ability to filter or create personalized suggestions. It becomes very difficult to sort through these large lists and find interesting things to do, and individuals may end up giving up and feeling bored once again.</P>

		    			<div class="hidden-h2"><h2>Research Analysis.</h2></div>

			    		<p><strong>PERSONAS. </strong>The team began the process by creating personas to help identify the goals, needs, and concerns of potential application users. This consisted of conducting interviews with a variety of individuals we believed may be interested in this style of mobile application. Information gathered from these interviews were then analysed and translated into different personas. Two examples are below.</p>


			    		<div class="col-1of2"><img src="img/persona1.png"></div>
			    		<div class="col-1of2"><img src="img/persona2.png"></div>


		    			
			    		<p><strong>PRINCIPLES. </strong>The team then ideated a set of principles based on the goals and needs of our personas that would inform any interface and design decisions. By staying within the constraints of these principles, we could ensure that the application was always being designed with our user’s goals and needs in mind.</p>

			    		<div class="grid">
			    			<div class="col-1of3"><p><strong>ANTICIPATORY. </strong>As our users want a personalized experience, Fillip should anticipate relevant activities based on user’s history.</p>
			    			</div>
			    			<div class="col-1of3"><p><strong>AUTONOMOUS. </strong>As our users aspire to make their own decisions, Fillip should give them resources, and act as a catalyst to find activities.</p>
			    			</div>
			    			<div class="col-1of3"><p><strong>DELIGHTFUL AND PLAYFUL. </strong>As our users are lighthearted and spontaneous, Fillip should have a personality to match this, using a voice and tone guide.</p>
			    			</div>
			    		</div>
			    		<div class="grid">			    		
			    			<div class="col-1of3"><p><strong>EFFICIENT. </strong>Our users are busy individuals who want to be spontaneous with any free time they have, so Fillip should maximise their productivity when finding activities.</p>
			    			</div>
			    			<div class="col-1of3"><p><strong>SOCIAL. </strong>Our users seek to spend quality time with their friends and family, so Fillip should help promote this while not getting in the way during the activities themselves.</p>
			    			</div>
			    			<div class="col-1of3"><p><strong>LOW RESISTANCE. </strong>As our users want to make quick decisions, Fillip should provide them with just enough information without an abundance of content.</p>
			    			</div>			    						    						  		
						</div>

			    		<p><strong>JOURNEY FRAMEWORK. </strong>A journey framework was then created with these principles in mind.</p>

	    			<div id="app-creation" class="final-interface">

	    				<div class="hidden-h2"><h2>App Creation.</h2></div>
						<p><strong>FINAL INTERFACE. </strong>Below are high-fidelity mockups of the final interface iteration, to help in illustrating the user's journey.</p>

	    			<div class="interface-image"><img src="img/filliphome.png"></div>
	    			<div class="interface-caption red"><p><strong>HOMESCREEN. </strong>Beginning from the homescreen, the application allows for simple filtration to only anticipate activities that are feasible for the user to do in that moment.</p></div>

	    			<div class="interface-image"><img src="img/fillipchoosingactivities.png"></div>
	    			<div class="interface-caption"><p><strong>CHOOSING ACTIVITIES. </strong>The more a user uses Fillip, the more it can anticipate and learn things that they will like. To try to prevent endless scrolling and swiping, we studied cognitive techniques to encourage choosing an activity. Placing two activities next to each other and choosing one over the other proved to be the most effective way to encourage snap decisions and spontaneity.</p></div>
